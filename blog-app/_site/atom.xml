        <title>Year in Review 2023</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;2023 had its share of ups and downs, with both joy and sorrow. It brought a mix of emotions and valuable life lessons. I was fortunate to form some fantastic global connections, but I also had to cope with the challenge of letting go of some important people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Year in Review 2022</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;2022 was a year of excitement and exploration. I got to do so many new things and experience life in a different way. Travel was a big part of this year. With the pandemic over, many restrictions were removed, allowing people to travel more freely. I was able to visit the City of Gold - Dubai and also many places in South India. I learned so much during my travels and also got to try so many delicious foods, explore different cultures, and meet new people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Taste a cup of tea playing with Arduino</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm Vasanth Gopa, joined d-shop, Bangalore as an Associate Software Developer Intern. I was wondering how people create cool hardware contraptions with Arduino and raspberry-pi, so I thought it would be a nice idea to write on after getting my hands dirty exploring these devices. So, the blog post will be revolving around my experience on these devices over a week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My childhood dream of flying</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As people usually do, I too had a lot of dreams when I was in school; flying in an airplane, traveling to a foreign country, making a name for myself, to name a few. I am delighted to say that I have brought many of my dreams to fruition during my under graduation in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and still continue to do so!&lt;/p&gt;
