                    <p>2023 had its share of ups and downs, with both joy and sorrow. It brought a mix of emotions and valuable life lessons. I was fortunate to form some fantastic global connections, but I also had to cope with the challenge of letting go of some important people.</p>

<p>Travel played a significant role in my year. I had the opportunity to explore Athens, the classic city; Paris, the fashion hub; Singapore, known as the city of lions; and California, the Golden State of the USA. During these trips, I enjoyed immersing myself in local cultures, staying in homestays, and experiencing the everyday life of these new cities.</p>

<p>A standout moment was my visit to Silicon Valley, where I met brilliant minds and explored the impressive offices, including Apple’s Cupertino ‘the ring’ campus and Google’s HQ in Mountain View.</p>

<p>Despite some lonely times, I’m grateful for Sreejith’s constant support throughout the year. While facing challenges, I managed to work on personal projects, improve my skills, and share my knowledge and experiences at various events and conferences. Here are some key highlights from 2023.</p>
