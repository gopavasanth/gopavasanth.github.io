2025 marks the end of my first innings and the beginning of the second. Life moved incredibly fast, taking me across countries, cultures, and experiences ✈️. I travelled to hashtag#Turkey 🇹🇷, hashtag#CzechRepublic 🇨🇿, hashtag#Kenya 🇰🇪, and hashtag#Indonesia 🇮🇩, learned new perspectives, and grew both personally and professionally. More than the places I visited, it was the journey itself that shaped me.

This phase of my life became truly special because it changed my personal world forever ❤️ I found my life partner 💍, spent time getting to know each other, travelled together, and built memories that will stay with me for a lifetime 📸. Watching two families come closer, sharing traditions, values, and countless special moments, made this year deeply meaningful and unforgettable ✨.

Alongside love and family ❤️, I continued to grow in my career by earning cloud certifications, contributing to open source 🌐, and working on impactful projects at American Express 💼. I was also grateful for the opportunity to serve as a member of the Wikimedia Foundation’s Regional Funding Committee, contributing as an advisor at the South Asia level. I am thankful for a successful first innings 🙏, and with hope and gratitude, I now step into my second innings, excited for everything that lies ahead 🚀.

There were celebrations 🎉, emotional moments, and unforgettable memories 💖. Balancing work, learning, travel, and personal milestones was challenging, but it made the journey even more rewarding 🌈. Here are some key highlights from 2025!
