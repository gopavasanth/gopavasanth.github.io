2023 had its share of ups and downs, with both joy and sorrow. It brought a mix of emotions and valuable life lessons. I was fortunate to form some fantastic global connections, but I also had to cope with the challenge of letting go of some important people.

Travel played a significant role in my year. I had the opportunity to explore Athens, the classic city; Paris, the fashion hub; Singapore, known as the city of lions; and California, the Golden State of the USA. During these trips, I enjoyed immersing myself in local cultures, staying in homestays, and experiencing the everyday life of these new cities.

A standout moment was my visit to Silicon Valley, where I met brilliant minds and explored the impressive offices, including Apple's Cupertino 'the ring' campus and Google's HQ in Mountain View.

Despite some lonely times, I'm grateful for Sreejith's constant support throughout the year. While facing challenges, I managed to work on personal projects, improve my skills, and share my knowledge and experiences at various events and conferences. Here are some key highlights from 2023.
