Yet another year comes to a close! 

2020 has not been the best year for mankind, with the glooming presence of COVID-19. It has been a testing time for everyone, and I am grateful to have stayed safe during the pandemic. My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected.

As always we must forge ahead with positivity and keep our head high, 2020 taught me a lot of things. I learned a lot of life skills and was able to widen my horizon technically as well. I collaborated, planned, shaped, built, launched, and marketed my very own large scale projects! and now I am close to graduating and would soon be stepping into my life as a professional. Traveling, cooking, hiking, coding, mentoring, and organizing filled me with tons of joy and made my year very exciting and beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è. An overview of my year is here.
