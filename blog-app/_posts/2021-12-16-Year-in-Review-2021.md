To sum up — 2021, for me, was a year of fresh beginnings, strenuous hikes, graduation with distinction, innovating, mentoring, learning new technologies, and exploring new ideas for side projects! It was also a year of making new colleagues as friends ;-)

After several years of schooling and study, Stepping into professional life with a fresh mind is a thrilling moment and Here is how I spent the year:
