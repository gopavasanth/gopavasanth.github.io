2022 was a year of excitement and exploration. I got to do so many new things and experience life in a different way. Travel was a big part of this year. With the pandemic over, many restrictions were removed, allowing people to travel more freely. I was able to visit the City of Gold - Dubai and also many places in South India. I learned so much during my travels and also got to try so many delicious foods, explore different cultures, and meet new people.

Another highlight of the year was relocating to the Silicon Valley of India - Bengaluru and starting to work from the office, meeting people in person after a year of virtual meetings. 

I also learned a lot this year. From developing personal skills to coding and delivering talks to a wider audience, I was able to work on my personal projects, enhance my skill set, and share my knowledge and experiences at various events and conferences. Here is a list of some key highlights of 2022:
