Like every year, 2024 brought its share of challenges and triumphs. The initial half of the year was particularly tough. While I focused on studying and earning certifications, it was also a time of learning to cope with difficult situations, navigating emotional setbacks for the first time, and losing people I never thought I’d have to let go of—especially close friends. Despite these hardships, I stayed committed to Open Source, traveling, and my regular work.

I’m deeply grateful to my incredible UG friends, especially Sreejith for always cheering me on, guiding me, and motivating me to move in the right direction, especially during the tough times. With their support, I slowly emerged from that challenging phase and shifted my focus to self-improvement and career growth.

This year also marked some incredible milestones: I traveled to five international countries and explored four new states in India. Here's a list of my accomplishments and key moments from 2024. Through the ups and downs, 2024 proved to be a year of resilience, growth, and discovery, entering into a new chapter in my life.
