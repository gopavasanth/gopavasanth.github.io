It was not easy to pen down a review of the year 2021, like I had done for [2020](https://gopavasanth.me/blog/Year-in-Review-2020) and [2019](https://gopavasanth.me/blog/Year-in-Review-2019).

To sum up — 2021, for me, was a year of fresh beginnings, strenuous hikes, graduation, innovating, mentoring, learning new technologies, and exploring new ideas for side projects! It was also a year of building my network and turning new colleagues into friends ;-)

After several years of schooling, stepping into professional life with a fresh mind was a unique experience, but unfortunately it was virtual for me. As I look back at what I've accomplished this year, I can not express my feelings of joy. There are too many to list, but here is a list of some key highlights I want to share:
